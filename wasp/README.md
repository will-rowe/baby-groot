# WASP

This is the Web ASembly Port for BABY-GROOT.

> this is work in progress...

To check out the current web version that is produced by this repo, go to [https://will-rowe.github.io/baby-groot](https://will-rowe.github.io/baby-groot/wasm/index.html)

Browser support is restricted to Chrome, Firefox and Opera for now.

##Â Issues

* can't load large index
  * runs out of memory when allocating
* premature terminations aren't graceful
  * they just print to the console, no notifications for user
  * in some cases, the application doesn't shut down
* can't handle multiple read files


## Running locally

To browserify the js, build the WASM binary and run the development server:

``` bash
make dev
```
